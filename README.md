# Master's Project

- `Final-Paper.pdf` is the final paper I turned in for my M.S. project in Applied Mathematics (Illinois Institute of Technology)
- `CompleteAnalysis.Rmd`: Main file containing all my R code.
- `CompleteAnalysis.html`: Informal presentations of my R code (knitted html version).
- `style.css`: Styling file uploaded to `CompleteAnalysis.Rmd` to produce the presentation file `CompleteAnalysis.html`.
- `Main-Data.csv`: Data for all IVs and Life Expectancy (DV) used in regression.
- `Demographics.csv`: Demographics for reference (not used in regression)
- `Code_Appendix.pdf`: Appendix providing details regarding most of my code. This pdf file is user friendly. It was produced via the `Code_Appendix.Rmd` file.
- `ACS-Variables.xlsx`: The original download of most of my variables in `Main-Data.csv`. It contains a data dictionary providing a description and the source for each variable.
